<p>Hello everyone, please note this. I started investing with this site (zbullprob) 8 months ago . At first they allowed me to place withdrawal then i thought that they are legit. After few months, i requested for another withdrawal since my investment have increased in profit, they demanded for huge fee and called it withdrawal fee and insurance fee. I was discussing with a friend and i told him my situation. He called his attorney and explained everything to him,he assisted me to review and recovered all my lost investments. You can recover yours by contacting this email ( lloydscheme At rediffmail Dot com ) he helped me and he will help you too. I am forever grateful to him.</p>

<p>1MJN7MrxG95B5h7dn4hpVhyUnjjEGnQZLo. I am very new to the Bticoin world, like days new! I am starting a foundation for my sister's genetic disease and thought this would be a wonderful way to fund such an important foundation. 95% of proceeds will go to research and treatment development for familia dysauntonomia! It is an extremely rare disease that limits the nervous system and reacts poorly to any malfunction of the body such as blood pressure, stress, and/or illness. Please contribute whatever you can to 1MJN7MrxG95B5h7dn4hpVhyUnjjEGnQZLo</p>

<p>A BIG dis-advantage is that you can not set where the program should download the data it is downloading. So it would be nice to see a option that you can enter the location where is going to put the 5GB of data, on a disc of your own choice with enough space. Many people use a prgram disc and a harddisc for data. Thanks!</p>

<p>The guy below me (bitcoinadvisor) is lying. Please do not send anything to anyone promising to "double your money." If you got a letter in the mail from someone you didn't know telling you that if you sent money to an address you never heard of, they would send you twice as much money back... would you do it? Now imagine there is no return address on the envelope, and the address to send the money to is a PO Box registered to John Doe? That is essentially what this guy is asking. The story is untrue, and the guy is an idiot. The wallet he wants you to send bitcoins to is empty. It has never had bitcoins sent to it. Odd for a money-doubling magician, right? Why wouldn't he just send a bitcoin to himself, double it, then repeat? There is a reason for that: it is a scam. bitcoinadvisor: if you're gonna try to scam people, do it on Bitcointalk like everybody else (where you will be called out on it). Keep this garbage off of the project page.</p>

<p>Works good ofcourse but the way it deals with updates, files and directories (W7) I find very confusing. There's 3 things that I like to save on separate locations: 1. the program files (small and needs to be updated) 2. the wallet (contains your money) and 3. the blockchaindata (because its big and getting even bigger). I got an old version installed with the pf on D: and now I want to update without losing my wallet and ofcourse without downloading the complete blockchain again. I tried several things but I am not able to work it out... Greatfullness for all the work by the bitcoindevelopers, but the truth is this program is not yet ready for serious use.</p>

<p>This is one of the most interesting alternatives to money I've ever seen. It's good to see it is already being used by many, and there is even a value on the open market. It's probably many years from achieving wide acceptance but I think history will look back on it kindly. The only reason I don't choose to use it yet is Paypal often siding with fraudulent sellers. They probably see Bitcoin as a threat, but I would be interested in seeing another payment provider besides Paypal.</p>

<p>Very good in concept, but one fatal flaw... calling it the "gold standard" of internet currency... gold doesn't magically disappear, that can happen to bit-coins if people delete their own copies of their own bitcoins, lose passwords, etc. That wouldn't be an issue except that there's effectively the limit on possible existing bitcoins. System could be improved by the creation of new bitcoins being affected by the number of bitcoins that are currently circulating instead of the total that have been created.</p>
